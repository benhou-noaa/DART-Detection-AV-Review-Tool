# Detection Audio-Visual Review Tool (DART)

## Introduction
Increasingly, bioacousticians are integrating artificial intelligence technologies into research operations. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particulary deep-learning, enable computers to perform complex analyses that have traditionally been relegated to human analysts. Successful integration of AI techniques into research operations allows research organizations to process large volumes of acoustical data in significantly less time and at potentially lower cost. 

Developing and implementing AI into research operations necessitates 

However, the successful use of AI for data analysis also requires
